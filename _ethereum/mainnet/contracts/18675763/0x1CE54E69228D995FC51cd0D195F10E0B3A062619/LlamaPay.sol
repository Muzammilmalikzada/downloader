// All amountPerSec and all internal numbers use 20 decimals, these are converted to the right decimal on withdrawal/deposit
// The reason for that is to minimize precision errors caused by integer math on tokens with low decimals (eg: USDC)

// Invariant through the whole contract: lastPayerUpdate[anyone] <= block.timestamp
// Reason: timestamps can't go back in time (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/consensus/ethash/consensus.go#L274 and block timestamp definition on ethereum's yellow paper)
// and we always set lastPayerUpdate[anyone] either to the current block.timestamp or a value lower than it
// We could use this to optimize subtractions and avoid an unneded safemath check there for some gas savings
// However this is obscure enough that we are not sure if a future ethereum network upgrade might remove this assertion
// or if an ethereum fork might remove that code and invalidate the condition, causing our deployment on that chain to be vulnerable
// This is dangerous because if someone can make a timestamp go back into the past they could steal all the money
// So we forgo these optimizations and instead enforce this condition.

// Another assumption is that all timestamps can fit in uint40, this will be true until year 231,800, so it's a safe assumption
